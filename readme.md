# ASTR7500
 My arsenal of statistics code and workbook submissions for AST7500

 I had to install clang to get this to work. I'm unsure of what else may be required.

To start I:
- ran powershell as admin
- created my astr7500 dir
- installed python using 'uv python install'
- set execution policy using 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned'
- created venv using 'uv venv'
- activated venv using '.\.venv\Scripts\activate'
